# This is Cooper Union
Restoration of the old NEW Cooper Union from archives "for educational and archival purposes"

**_DISCLAIMER:_** The views and thoughts expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of the contributors of this project.
Currently, it is a mere replicate of the original page that used to be hosted on [http://cooperunion.biz](https://web.archive.org/web/20140517063518/http://cooperunion.biz/), so most of the credits go to the creators of cooperunion.biz (hereafter referred to as, _cu.biz_).

The files were pulled off Archive.org's [WaybackMachine](http://archive.org/web/) where one can see older snapshots of a page.
As of now, most of the files in this project are still hosted on cu.biz archive on the waybackmachine.
However, there are efforts to download the resources and fix this links into this repo.
**This page is currently missing some of the images and fonts.**

The exact snapshot I used was the [snapshot from May 17, 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20140517063518/http://cooperunion.biz/).
I've also found [this trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_the_Wayback_Machine#Specific_archive_copy) to be useful to see the original, unmodified contents.

Any contributions will be welcomed, as long as it is reasonable and within the scope of this... idk.
Contributions can be made via [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and will be merged upon approval.
Suggestions can be sent either in person or submitting it on the issues page.
Uhh... or just tell somebody else to do it.

It would've been nice if I were able to get cooperunion.biz, but it was either unavailable or not as cheap as I expected.
Instead, there are some other nice domains I _was_ able to get :)

The pages are planned to go live here:
* [http://cooperunion.rip](http://cooperunion.rip)
* [http://cooperunion.loan](http://cooperunion.loan)
* [http://cooper.party](http://cooper.party)
* [http://cooper.pizza](http://cooper.pizza)
